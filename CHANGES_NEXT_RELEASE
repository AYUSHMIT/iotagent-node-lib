- Set Nodejs 12 as minimum version in packages.json (effectively removing Nodev10 from supported versions)
- New INVALID EXPRESSION policy at JEXL expression in attributes and entity_names. Defaul values will be propagated and a warn will be logged instead of exception ([#1292](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib/issues/1292))
